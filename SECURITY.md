# Security Policy

## Reporting Security Vulnerabilities

We take the security of the Cai Stack seriously and appreciate any efforts to responsibly disclose vulnerabilities. If you discover any security vulnerabilities or potential threats, please report them by creating a private security advisory on GitHub or emailing the maintainers directly. We request that you provide sufficient information to reproduce the vulnerability, including steps to replicate, affected versions, and any additional details that may be helpful for our investigation.

### Scope

This security policy applies to all versions of the Cai Stack hosted on the official repository on GitHub.

### Response Time

Our security team will make every effort to respond to your report promptly. We aim to acknowledge receipt of your vulnerability report within 10 business days and will provide an estimated timeline for when you can expect a resolution. We appreciate your patience and understanding as we work to address the issue.

### Disclosure Policy

Once a vulnerability has been identified and confirmed, we will work towards resolving the issue in a responsible and timely manner. Our policy is to disclose the vulnerability to the public after a fix has been developed and released to address the issue. We will coordinate with you to ensure that the disclosure is made in a coordinated manner to protect users of the Cai Stack.

### Fix and Patching Process

Our team will prioritize the reported vulnerabilities based on their severity and impact on the project. We will develop and test patches to address the vulnerabilities and release them as soon as possible. The timeline for patching may vary depending on the complexity of the vulnerability and the availability of our team members.

### Acknowledgment

We value and appreciate the efforts of individuals who responsibly disclose vulnerabilities to us. If you report a vulnerability, we will acknowledge your contribution unless you request to remain anonymous. If you wish to be publicly acknowledged for your discovery, please let us know when submitting your report.
