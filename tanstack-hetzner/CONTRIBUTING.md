## Coding Standards

### TypeScript

- Export types separately from implementations
- Use meaningful variable and function names

### React

- Use functional components with hooks
- Keep components small and focused
- Use proper TypeScript types for props
- Follow React best practices

### Testing

- Write tests for new features
- Maintain test coverage above 80%
- Use meaningful test descriptions
- Test both happy paths and edge cases

### Git Commit Messages

- Use the present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature")
- Use the imperative mood ("Move cursor to..." not "Moves cursor to...")
- Limit the first line to 72 characters or less
- Reference issues and pull requests liberally after the first line
